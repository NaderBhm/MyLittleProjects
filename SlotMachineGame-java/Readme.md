# Java Slot Machine 🎰

This is a simple **Slot Machine game** built with **Java** as part of my learning journey.  
The game simulates a basic slot machine where players bet money and spin for a chance to win big!

## 📂 Files

## 🎮 How to Play

1. You start with a balance of **$100**.
2. Enter your bet amount.
3. The machine will **spin 3 random symbols** from 🍉🍎🍒🍓🌶️.
4. Based on the result:
   - **No match** → You lose your bet.
   - **Two matches** → You win 5× your bet.
   - **Three matches** (Jackpot) → You win 10× your bet!
5. Keep playing until you run out of money or choose to quit.
